# 5. Longest Palindormic Substring

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
```
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## Troubles

Had some troubles, started out with going from large to small, buit should've immediatly realised that going the other way around is a lot more efficient. There is also a dynamic programming version.
